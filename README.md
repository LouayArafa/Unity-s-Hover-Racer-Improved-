# Unity-s-Hover-Racer--Improved-
 Vehicle Movement and hover from Unity's official tutorial(2018) but I also integrate the new input system in it.

watch this if you want to know how to handle the new input system: https://youtu.be/oXDw1k0Ti-Y


**Note:** to fix the bug where the vehicle tilts or starts shaking when hitting other objects, just freeze the rotation on X and Y from Rigidbody. this won't stop the banking effects because it does not apply to the vehicle's body.
